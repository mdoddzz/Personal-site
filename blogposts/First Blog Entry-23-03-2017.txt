This is the first blog post on this site. This site is my current main project over the Christmas holidays, I have spent about a week to get to the point where I am happy to release it to represent me and my skills, there is obviously a lot more I want to add to this site as I learn new skills and improve existing ones I have. I am very proud of the work I have done on the site this is probably the third of forth time I have redesigned my personal site and this is the closest to the professional standard I have been looking for. Some of the plans I have for this website revolves around this blog, I did not opt to use WordPress even with the experience I do have with it I wanted the challenge of creating all the code from scratch to create it and in the process improve my PHP skills which most defiantly I have.  I want to add features such as logins and commenting and forums (obviously, all secured and done correctly with the right licence's so may take some time and investment).  

I hope to keep you updated on the website project. Thank you for reading, looking forward to the future of this site.
